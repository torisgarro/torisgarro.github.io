                <h2>Megaphone is a dynamic ad platform for enterprise podcast publishers, including Gimlet, Slate and HowStuffWorks. We opened this technology to hobbyist podcasters.
                </h2>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Megaphone has been successful by creating a top product in a small marketplace: technology for enterprise podcasters. But independent and professional podcasters have many more options. With all the competitors out there, why would they choose Megaphone – especially when it would mean going through the hassle of switching platforms?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="marginTop">Use What The Pros Use</h3>
                <p>In order to convince smaller podcasters to switch over to Megaphone, we realized our product needed to offer easy onboarding, opportunities for growth, and competitive features and pricing. After several initial user interviews, we understood that our target user sees his/her podcast as a side hustle, but wants to take it to the next step – whether that’s growing a wider audience, making more money from ads, or even podcasting full-time. So we wanted to position Megaphone as an opportunity for hobbyists to “use what the pros use,” fostering credibility with the name-recognition of our enterprise clients.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="marginTop">Onboarding</h3>
                <p>We personally onboard enterprise clients, but this wouldn’t be possible with our anticipated high volume of independent users. We created a self-serve onboarding experience starting from Megaphone’s marketing site. Our focus was usability and clarity in order to keep our customer support calls down, while also keeping in mind that this experience would serve as an introduction to Megaphone’s personality and voice.</p>

            <h3>Audience Exchange</h3>
            <p>In addition to our current enterprise features that are applicable and useful to independent users, we also rolled out a new feature set to offer more value to these new users: Megaphone’s audience exchange. Audience exchange allows users to enter into a new marketplace and exchange show promos with other Megaphone users for credit. Running a promo for your show in someone else’s show (or vice versa) allows you to grow your audience, and also creates a sense of community among the network. In building out these features, we also had to consider the onboarding experience, since no one from our team would be able to walk users through the exchange.</p>

            <h3>Delightful Details</h3>
            <p>Megaphone currently builds strong relationships with clients through personal relationships and 24-hour customer support. However, we can’t have this kind of interaction with our smaller users. Instead, design became our opportunity to show our brand’s personality and create relationships with customers. For that reason, I added moments of delight with illustration throughout the experience. If we had more time, I also would have loved to focus on animations and microinteractions for the same reason – something we will hopefully be able to return to in the future.</p>
