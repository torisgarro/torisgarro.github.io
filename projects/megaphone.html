                <h2>Megaphone is a dynamic ad platform for podcast publishers, including Gimlet, Slate and HowStuffWorks. I led
                    the design of features to forecast ad impressions in Megaphone.
                </h2>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Before this project, Megaphone allowed clients to sell ad inventory by offering ad placement in a podcast
                    over time (e.g. “Casper’s ad will run in these specific four episodes of Revisionist History for three
                    weeks”). But we wanted to sign a top network who sells ad inventory in a different way: by selling ad
                    impressions over time (e.g. “Casper’s ad will run in any episode of Revisionist History until 100,000
                    people listen to it”).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="marginTop">Strategy</h3>
                <p>In order to introduce this new mode of selling into Megaphone, we needed to forecast the number of future
                    impressions available on a podcast show or episode. We also needed to enable sellers to book these impressions
                    and pace their delivery over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="marginTop">User Interviews</h3>
                <p>For context, we interviewed a handful of our enterprise clients about their existing ad sales processes,
                    thinking about how this new way of selling ad inventory could fit into their workflow. We learned that
                    they used internal spreadsheets to track their ad inventory, and they used their own data to forecast
                    future available impressions. These conversations confirmed that we were addressing the right design
                    problem with this feature set. We also learned that some clients use multiple modes of selling ad inventory
                    in tandem.</p>

            <h3>Searching</h3>
            <p>Our initial research revealed that searching for and viewing relevant ad inventory would be crucial to selling
                by impressions. We explored different search filters and ways of visualizing search results. Based on our
                interviews, we knew that users were interested not just in looking up future unsold impressions, but also
                future sold impressions. This is because users still view sold inventory as “available” ad space, since they
                often swap out ads if needed. Our final data visualization of forecasted impressions reflects this insight.</p>

        <div class="main-content-grid__pageText" data-scroll>
            <h3>Don't Overcomplicate</h3>
            <p>After testing wireframes with users, we realized our design’s many filter options actually narrowed their inventory
                search results too quickly. At this point in their process, they were still exploring their options – they
                didn’t want to be limited by anything as specific as the position or geo-target of their ad.</p>
            <p>When we removed the unnecessary filters, we found that our search page was beginning to look a lot like another
                existing screen in our platform – our reports. We ended up adapting our report design to this use case, instead
                of creating an entirely new flow, as we’d originally planned. Though this solution was a bit of a compromise
                in design, it allowed us to use existing components in the platform, making more efficient use of our developer’s
                time and allowing us to meet our release deadline.
            </p>
            <h3 class="marginTop">Launch</h3>
            <p>With the successful launch of this feature set, we signed a top network to Megaphone – adding 50 million monthly
                downloads, thereby doubling our ad inventory. We now also support a new mode of selling ad inventory that
                is widely believed to be the future of the podcast industry – establishing us as an industry leader and opening
                the door to future clients who sell in this way.
