                    <h4>The Opportunity</h4>
                    <p>At The Atlantic, we know that readers turn to us for our editorial judgment, trusting our editors
                        to curate our journalism for them. Our newsroom isn’t bound to the daily news cycle; we cover
                        the most important stories and look for trends in the news across a longer timeframe.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we know that our readers have their own favorite writers and topics, and
                        perhaps the most valuable version of The Atlantic balances these two needs. We can create a
                        dynamic experience that helps our readers to connect with the stories that they’re already
                        interested in, without getting away from the value of curation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="projectImage" data-scroll>
                    <img src="../assets/images/customization-brainstorm.jpg" alt="Brainstorm Prompts"
                        class="largePhoto">
                    <h5 class="caption">We started to brainstorm around this opportunity with editors, product managers,
                        and designers.</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="projectText" data-scroll>
                    <h4>Our Framework</h4>
                    <p>As we tested early designs with readers both familiar with and new to The Atlantic, we began to
                        notice patterns in how readers want to find their next story. I worked with our audience
                        researcher, Mollie Leavitt, to define three different preferences: <strong>curation</strong>,
                        <strong>customization</strong> and <strong>personalization</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>As predicted, we learned that The Atlantic products already serve readers who value editorial
                        curation. These readers trust our editors to recommend the most important ideas and
                        conversations of our time, as well as stories that they wouldn’t necessarily seek out on their
                        own – all within a finite and complete experience. The Atlantic Daily newsletter and our app’s
                        Today feed – both of which offer a short list (in different formats) of The Atlantic’s best
                        reads
                        of the day – serve these readers well.</p>
                    <p>But many other readers expect a more personally relevant experience – featuring topics, writers,
                        and stories they’re already interested in. Both customization and personalization offer a means
                        to providing a more personally relevant experience to readers, but we discovered that each
                        addresses slightly different motivations. A reader may prefer customization (when she chooses
                        her own experience to meet her own need, like following a favorite writer) if she wants more
                        agency in determining what stories she sees. Another reader may prefer personalization (when an
                        algorithm chooses his experience to meet his anticipated need, like suggesting a new writer to
                        follow based on who he already follows) if he prefers the “magic” feel of an algorithm making
                        frictionless suggestions.</p>

                <div class="projectText" data-scroll>
                    <p>In expanding our product strategy to serve readers who value a personalized experience, we don’t
                        want to diminish or replace our editorial curation; we want to complement it with customization
                        and personalization. The last thing we want to do is lose readers’ trust by creating an echo
                        chamber solely optimized for engagement. This means asking ourselves questions like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How might we show stories that are relevant to everyone alongside stories that are relevant
                            to you personally?
                        </li>
                        <li>How might we introduce you to a story that you may not choose on your own, while ensuring
                            that you don’t miss out on a story that you’re already interested in?
                        </li>
                        <li>How might we create a complete experience that respects your time and doesn’t overwhelm you,
                            while avoiding redundancy or a feeling of “I’ve already seen this”?
                        </li>
                        <li>How might we respect your privacy while getting to know you better when you judge this
                            relationship to be worthwhile?
                        </li>

                    <h4>Keep Up With Your Interests</h4>
                    <p>The Atlantic launched our award-winning iOS app in 2019, and we credit much of that launch’s
                        success to the
                        app’s reimagined home screen: a unique Today feed that feels like a daily edition of a
                        mini-magazine. As you might expect, this approach (giving readers a short list of The Atlantic’s
                        best reads of the day, as chosen by our app editors) is a hit for readers who value editorial
                        curation. A recent email from one such reader:
                    </p>
                    <p><i>“I love the simplicity of the Today screen!! And
                            how you scroll vertically, only seeing one piece at a time. Please don’t make it like the
                            home
                            screen page of NYTimes or anything resembling an Instagram grid with too much content. You
                            get
                            so much credibility for carefully selecting 5-6 articles each day!!”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>We’ve also received the exact opposite feedback. For some readers, the app’s Today feed feels
                        irrelevant to them personally. One reader told us that she’s a big fan of our parenting
                        coverage, but it rarely qualifies as a top story. She finds that Facebook, a platform that gets
                        to know her and her interests over time, actually better connects her with The Atlantic’s latest
                        parenting story than any of our own products.
                    </p>
                    <p>She’s right. We have expert coverage of all sorts of topics that aren’t always the most urgent
                        news of the moment. The challenge is connecting readers with these specific stories. Currently,
                        they feel like they’re missing out on some of this coverage. With that in mind, we’re exploring
                        a feature to allow readers to customize their app experience by following writers and topics,
                        which then surface in the Today feed and throughout the rest of the app alongside editorially
                        curated stories.

                    <h4>Pick Up Where You Left Off</h4>
                    <p>We often hear that many readers already feel overwhelmed by news generally­, which can keep them
                        from engaging with The Atlantic’s ambitious, long-form journalism. So we recognized the
                        opportunity to help readers make progress on and finish stories through customization and
                        personalization. That includes a cross-platform experience to save articles to your account for
                        later, even marking your exact place in an article if desired. While you might not get through a
                        20,000-word cover story in one sitting, we can make the best experience out of reading the first
                        few pages and coming back to it later. We pictured a reader starting that story on her computer
                        during her lunch break, picking it back up in the app on her phone on her commute home, and even
                        finishing it as an audio story in our (still hypothetical) TV app at home that evening.
