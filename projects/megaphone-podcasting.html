                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>Megaphone has been successful by creating a top product in a small marketplace: technology for
                        enterprise podcasters. But independent podcasters have many more options. With all the
                        competitors out there, why would they choose Megaphone – especially when it would mean going
                        through the hassle of switching platforms?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="projectText" data-scroll>
                    <h4>Use What the Pros Use</h4>
                    <p>In order to convince smaller podcasters to switch over to Megaphone, we realized our product
                        needed to offer easy onboarding, opportunities for professional growth, and competitive features
                        and pricing. After several user interviews, we understood that our target user currently
                        produces his/her podcast as a side hustle, but wants to take it to the next step – with the
                        ultimate goal of podcasting full-time. So we wanted to position Megaphone as an opportunity for
                        an aspiring podcaster to “use what the pros use,” fostering credibility with the
                        name-recognition of our enterprise clients.</p>

                    <h4>A New Look</h4>
                    <p>As a part of our work to target Megaphone to this new audience, we decided to refresh Megaphone’s
                        brand and visual identity. Despite now opening Megaphone to a consumer audience, we emphasized
                        our enterprise brand with our new design. Our product’s enterprise background is its best
                        differentiator, so we didn’t want our design to feel too consumer-oriented.</p>
                    <p>I worked with our marketing team to update our product’s brand colors, typeface, logo and overall
                        tone. I also saw an opportunity to begin documenting an evolving design system. We used our
                        newly defined design to create a cohesive experience from our marketing site, through
                        onboarding, to the in-app experience.</p>

                    <h4>Audience Exchange</h4>
                    <p>We stripped away any enterprise features not relevant to independent users, and decided to roll
                        out a new feature set to offer more value to these users: Megaphone’s audience exchange. The
                        audience exchange allows users to enter into a new marketplace and exchange show promos with
                        other Megaphone users for credit. Running a promo for your show in someone else’s show (or vice
                        versa) allows you to grow your audience, and creates a sense of community with other independent
                        podcasters.
                    </p>
