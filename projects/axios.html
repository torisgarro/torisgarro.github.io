                <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
                <p>I joined Axios right as the company kicked off a website redesign in time for its third birthday.
                    Leadership had just approved the team’s overall website redesign strategy: improve the experience of
                    our “engaged users” – only about 1% of Axios’ audience of eight million, but also the most likely to
                    convert to our other products (newsletters and a soon-to-be-launched app).</p>

            <p><strong>Situational Awareness</strong></p>
            <p>As the sole designer on the project, I led our user discovery research to help contextualize our work. We interviewed seven engaged users (users who had frequently visited Axios.com
                directly) and four unengaged users (users who had visited an Axios story via a “side door” like
                social or search) to learn more about their general digital behavior and media consumption
                habits, and their impressions and use of Axios.com.</p>
            <p>Through this process, we validated that engaged users’ main “Jobs To Be Done” on Axios.com are:
                <b>situational awareness</b> (to catch up on what Axios thinks matters now) and <b>news
                    analysis</b> (to read Axios’ coverage of and take on a topic). We further segmented engaged
                users into four groups based on their motivations and behavior (see below). While our existing
                site best served the “FOMO-er” – someone who values frictionless and constant consumption of the
                news – addressing the other three segments offered an opportunity for the redesign.</p>

            <p><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p>
            <p>The website redesign became the design team’s most public facing project. To include stakeholders early
                in the redesign process, I led ideation sessions with different
                groups (editorial, growth, client partnerships) based on the user stories I created from the research.
            </p>
            <p>In our ideation process, I also found inspiration from products intended for habitual use. The Calm
                meditation app, for example, extends its brand of “calmness” through the user journey – surfacing the
                most important content and then offering the user a sense of completion, and measuring success by
                sessions completed and sessions per week rather than time spent in the app. How might Axios similarly
                extend our brand of “trustworthiness” to the user journey?

            <p><strong>Reality Check</strong></p>
            <p>
                Halfway through the project, however, our design priorities changed; we discovered that company
                leadership and our product team disagreed about the impetus for the redesign. It turned out that SEO
                (and relatedly, ad revenue), rather than user experience, was the most important factor driving the
                redesign from the top. We pivoted from our engaged users to our unengaged users – focusing on growing
                our “side door” traffic from social and search. In addition to this mid-project shift, we received a
                hard deadline to launch the redesigned site in three months, in time for Axios’ third
                anniversary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our biggest challenge became balancing user needs with business needs (SEO and advertising) in a short
                time frame. Designing for SEO and designing for our users sometimes aligned: we rethought the site’s
                information architecture to reflect users’ mental models with the help of a card sorting exercise,
                traded an infinite scroll for pagination, and added a content archive. But we also made compromises in
                our design decisions: to the dismay of our most loyal users (defined as the “FOMO-er” in our
                research), we replaced our unique inline story unfurl with a more traditional full story page, and we
                prioritized the mobile experience over desktop.

            <p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
            <p>Given that our new site – especially the MVP version – caters to SEO and side door traffic, our most
                engaged users lamented some of the changes made. If we had worked with a longer timeline, we
                could have eased the transition by preparing our audience with a more transparent and gradual roll out
                of the new design. Ultimately though, the success of the redesign (from the perspective of our company)
                is measured by Google’s response to it.</p>

            <p><strong>What's Next</strong></p>
            <p>Now that we’ve launched the MVP of Axios’ new site, we have the time to develop our earlier
                user research findings, to define UX metrics for the site, and to user test future features. As we continue to iterate,
                we hope to find a better equilibrium between user needs (the experience of engaged users) and business
                needs (SEO, advertising, side door traffic).
            </p>
            <p>Early SEO metrics are promising: we increased <b>search traffic from 12% of total traffic to 20%</b>
                within a month. Within two months, we increased our baseline of 75,000 daily Google-referred sessions on
                Axios.com to <b>400,000 sessions on a given day, a 5x increase</b>. We have also experienced our
                <b>seven biggest traffic days</b> (with a record of <b>2.81 million sessions</b> in a day) in the
                history of the company.</p>
