                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Customization (when a user chooses their experience to meet their need) and personalization (when a product delivers an experience to a user in anticipation of their need) can create more relevant experiences for readers, encouraging habitual use and improving retention. However, many readers love The Atlantic for its editorial judgement – trusting editors to curate the most important stories. How might we serve readers who want a more relevant experience via customization and/or personalization, without alienating readers who value editorial curation (our biggest fans)?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="projectText" data-scroll>
                    <h3>Our Framework</h3>
                    <p>As we began testing early designs with readers both familiar and unfamiliar with The Atlantic, we began to notice patterns in how readers want to discover content. I worked with our audience researcher to define three different content recommendation preferences: curation, customization and personalization. (Readers can shift between these preferences depending on their context.) We learned that The Atlantic products already serve subscribers who value editorial curation, but many other readers expect a more personally relevant experience.</p>
                    <p>We decided to focus on maintaining the value of editorial curation, while complementing that experience with customization features. (We decided that personalization would come later, led by the data science team.) Customization gives the user control and requires deliberate action – and therefore represents a suitable intermediate step between curation and personalization.</p>

                    <h3>"Today" in the App</h3>
                    <p>The Atlantic launched a new iOS app in 2019. Much of that launch’s success was credited to the app’s reimagined home screen: a unique Today feed that feels like a daily edition of a mini-magazine. The Today feed succeeded with readers who value editorial curation – but maintaining a daily edition of the feed required a lot of work from our editors, and the format didn’t resonate with readers who don’t value editorial curation. In beginning to incorporate customization into our app, I knew that perfecting the balance between curation and customization in our Today feed was crucial to improving our app for all subscribers.</p>

                    <h3>Follow Your Interests</h3>
                    <p>We learned that readers who don’t value editorial curation felt that the app’s Today feed is irrelevant to them personally. We saw many of these readers work around the Today feed by immediately navigating to the Latest tab (a condensed and chronologically ordered feed) or to the Sections tab. While The Atlantic already offers expert coverage on niche topics, readers still felt like they were missing out on content relevant to their specific interests. To address this need, I designed a feature to allow readers to customize their app experience by following writers and topics, which then surface in the Latest tab.</p>

                    <h3>A Sense of Completion</h3>
                    <p>We introduced customization in order to surface more relevant content to readers, but we couldn’t ignore that many readers already felt overwhelmed by content – a major barrier to engaging with The Atlantic’s long-form journalism. We included several customization features meant to help readers make progress on and finish articles. I designed a cross-platform experience to save articles for later and to pick up where you left off in an article on any device.
